# Data logger

## About 
This proyect allows recording data of different gases from a biodigester. For that, it is used a microcontroller with different gass sensors who are record data into a SD Card. 

The microcontroller have two sources of energy, the main is by a charged with the electric current and the other one is by an external battery. The last one is in case of the electric current charged fail.
 
## Microcontroller

### Process of sensors calibration
--in progress--

## Data
The data is written in a .txt file with the name "ANALOGXX" where each X can be a number from 0 to 9. That format name is for avoid overwrite files.

Into the "ANALOGXX" file, each row represent a data reading. Each sensor data is separed by  comma "," , and the last value of the row is the date of the moment when the data was taken.

The id of each column can be found in the "FORMAT.TXT" file.

## Batteries
